# AstroDevWork

AstroDevWork is a small, collaborative organization created to bring contributors together across my various projects.

It exists for one reason: to give people a shared space to build, maintain, and improve software together over time, instead of scattering effort across disconnected repositories.

This is not a company, not a startup pitch, and not a bureaucracy. It is a team.

## Purpose

AstroDevWork was set up to:

* Centralize development across multiple projects
* Make collaboration easier for long term contributors
* Maintain continuity as projects grow, change, or get handed off
* Encourage clean code, shared ownership, and responsible maintenance

If you are here, you are part of the team, not a temporary guest.

## How We Work

Projects under AstroDevWork may differ in language, scope, or maturity, but they follow the same core ideas:

* Code should be readable, maintainable, and documented
* Decisions should be discussed openly in issues or pull requests
* Contributions should improve the project, not just add features
* Ownership is shared, responsibility is expected

No ego driven development. No drive by commits that disappear forever.

## Contributing

If you are a collaborator:

1. Pick a project you are interested in
2. Read the project specific README and guidelines
3. Open issues for bugs, ideas, or design discussions
4. Submit pull requests with clear intent and explanations

If something is unclear, ask. Silence breaks projects faster than bad code.

## Projects

AstroDevWork hosts multiple projects, each with its own goals and documentation. There is no requirement to contribute to everything. Focus where you can add value.

Active and archived projects will be clearly marked in their repositories.

## Joining the Team

AstroDevWork is intentionally small. Collaborators are invited based on interest, consistency, and alignment with how we work.

If you are contributing already, you are part of it.
